Used for the Find/Replace function in VBA in Excel to export data from the .xlsm to a 
single .docx or .docm file of the user's choice (this is a specific example, therefore
it links to a specific .docx; to make it choose a general .docx/.docm and work properly,
change the C: path in VBA.)

Run the Macro FindReplace.
